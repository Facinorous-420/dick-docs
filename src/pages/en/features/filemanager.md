This tab is found on the `User Dashboard`, and allows the user to view all their files they have saved in the ASS server.

On this page the user can see thumbnails, size, and date of upload of their files.<br/>
They can also delete individual files.

This page is sorted automatically where new uploads will appear first.<br/>
As you scroll down, more files will load in until you have loaded all your files.

*Added in v1.0.0*
