<p style="color: orange;">Admin Only Feature</p>

This is the main tab of the `Admin Dashboard`, and allows an administrator to edit their DICK and ASS settings.

## Main Settings

The tab allows the administrator to white label their instance, to read more check out the [white label documentation page](/dick-docs/en/configs/whitelabel).

As well as this, they can enable hCaptcha and configure it:

#### hCaptcha Enabled
If enabled, your instance will use hCaptcha for the login and register pages, if disabled it will only send failed logins to a Rick Roll.

#### hCaptcha Site ID
This is the hcaptcha site id if you plan to use hCaptcha as captcha to protect your DICK instance.

#### hCaptcha Secret Key
This is the hcaptcha secret key found in your hcaptcha account if you plan to use hCaptcha as captcha to protect your DICK instance.

*Added in v1.1.0*
