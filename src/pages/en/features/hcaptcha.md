You can enable hCaptcha to protect your login and registration routes. By default, this is turned off and all incorrect logins will be redirected into a rick-roll.

To get started, [enable hcaptcha in the app settings](/dick-docs/en/features/appsettings).<br/>
Then grab your site and secret keys from [hCaptcha's website](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) and add them to the app settings page.

More detailed instructions will be included in the release of v2.0.0

*Added in v1.1.0*
