## About The Project

Dick was created to be an easy to use front end for <a href="https://github.com/tycrek/ass">Ass</a> as there was no public option to allow users to view their saved images on their server. I decided to learn tailwind and also at the same time build this. I did this all in my spare time, and will keep updating as best as I can while I use it. I'm still learning all this so if anyone has suggestions on how to do things better, I am all ears! I love learning! :)

**Current Feautres:**
1. General statistics on your file uploads
2. File browser, allows you to see all your uploads on one webpage
3. Deletion of items
4. Copy link of items
5. Customize DICK (completely white label)
6. Register new ASS users
7. hCaptcha on login and register pages <a href="https://www.hcaptcha.com/">You can learn more here</a>.
