Not everyone likes flashing their DICKs to everyone, I get that. That is why when building this project, I made sure customizability was one of the top focuses of this project.

Customization is easy, and a vast majority of DICK can be changed.<br/>
Currently, you can change all these options using the [admin panel](/dick-docs/en/features/adminpanel).
